# Nightingale
Hobby operating system project

# Current Status
Don't make plans for ditching your Linux/Mac/Windows rigs just yet. 
Currently, the Nightingale kernel is at the stage where it can print a
hello world message on the screen and not crash. The next step is to get
input from the keyboard and echo that on the screen, which is well
underway. The point here is that this is a hobby project which I am using
to experiment with different OS related concepts.

# Compiling Nightingale
There is a script provided which compiles the kernel, prepares a disk
image file, and installs GRUB and the kernel onto the disk image. Run
the script build-virtual-disk as root.
