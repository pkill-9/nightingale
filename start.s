/**
 *  Entry point for a simple demo kernel.
 *
 *  This assumes use of a multiboot compliant loader, such as GRUB, and as
 *  such the initial environment should be:
 *  - 32 bit protected mode enabled.
 *  - interrupts disabled.
 *  - segment registers set up to have a base of 0 and limit of 4GiB.
 *  - ebx points to a multiboot info struct.
 *
 *  The purpose of this code is to set up the GDT and IDT; set up a stack
 *  and then hand over to the main C code.
